# Classifying-Textual-Data-with-Fuzzy-KNN

KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) is a type of supervised classification algorithm that finds the classes of k number of neighbors closest to candidate. The algorithm returns the most popular class found in the neighbors. Fuzzy KNN no only returns the class, but returns the percentage of all the classes that the candidate is similar to.

To use:
Program uses Stanford's Corenlp for some of the NER work.
To use, you need to train with documents that are seperated class folders.
To test, you will need to point it to a folder of test documents.
Program can output both KNN and Fuzzy KNN.
